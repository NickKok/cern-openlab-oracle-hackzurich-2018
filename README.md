# CERN openlab Oracle Collaboration Hackzurich 2018

Welcome to CERN openlab Oracle collaboration for the HackZurich 2018 repository. If you are reading this probably it means that you have accepted our challenge, horaaay!
In this repository you will find some information that can help you to develop your application. As it was explained during the [workshop](http://hackzurich.com/#HACK/workshops)  our challenge consist in building a **virtual guest book** for the **CERN Open Days**.
In 2013, CERN opened its doors to the public in the [CERN Open Days 2013](https://home.cern/about/updates/2013/09/cern-open-days-70000-happy-visitors). In this repository you can find the **data-sources** used in the [CERN Open Days app](https://opendays2013.web.cern.ch/app):

Probably [visit-points](visit-points) is going to be the **most interesting datasource** for you. It contains all the information, like coordinates, description, pictures, about the different visit points at CERN, like the [ATLAS exhibition point](https://github.com/cerndb/cern-openlab-oracle-hackzurich-2018/blob/master/visit-points/all_points_full.json#L46)

 In the [database](database) folder you will find the json dump of the database used in the 2013 app. For instance you can find information about the [lectures](/database/DB_DUMP.json#L54) that were held during the event.

[shuttle-buses](shuttle-buses) will give you the bus stops coordinates, the schedule of the shuttles and the maps (in pdf format) of the two CERN sites, Meyrin and Prevessin.

[sites-info](sites-info) contains other useful information like the coordinates of all the buildings and the always good to know where is the closest toilet please!!!

Last, but not least, in the [logo](logo) folder you will find a selection of CERN logos.  

## Other information
### Sounds from the LHC!
In this [link](https://cernbox.cern.ch/index.php/s/z44Y6Iwy7d6IfxI) you will find some recordings of the [CERN Data Centre](http://information-technology.web.cern.ch/about/computer-centre). Also it can be very interesting for your application some ambient music resulting from the [sonification   of a LHC dipole magnet](https://home.cern/about/updates/2017/09/melody-magnets). Other examples of sonification can be found [here](https://sciencenode.org/visualization/celebrating-cern-sounds-science.php)
### CERN Multimedia
Although you can explore the [full collection](http://cds.cern.ch/?ln=en) of CERN multimedia we strongly recommend you to use [this one](https://press.cern/multimedia). Here you have a very nice selection of images, videos and animations that can improve the user experience of your application.     
### GIS
CERN maintains its own [Geographic Information System](https://maps.cern.ch/). It displays useful geographic data and  allowing its users to search for buildings, rooms and locations at CERN. A [mobile application](https://smb-dep.web.cern.ch/en/content/gis_mobile) also exists.
### LHC data processing
Wonder how the data produced by 600 million collisions is processed? Have a look [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDC3-QSiLB4)
### 360 panorama pictures
These collection of pictures can be very useful if you think about adding some VR functionality to your app:
