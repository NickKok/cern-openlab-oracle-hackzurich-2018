# CERN openlab Oracle Collaboration Hackzurich 2018

Welcome to CERN openlab Oracle collaboration for the HackZurich 2018 repository. If you are reading this probably it means that you have accepted our challenge, horaaay!
In this repository you will find some information that can help you to develop your application. As it was explained during the [workshop](http://hackzurich.com/#HACK/workshops)  our challenge consist in building a **virtual guest book** for the **CERN Open Days**.
In 2013, CERN opened its doors to the public in the [CERN Open Days 2013](https://home.cern/about/updates/2013/09/cern-open-days-70000-happy-visitors). In this repository you can find the **data-sources** used in the [CERN Open Days app](https://opendays2013.web.cern.ch/app):
 
 In the [database](database) folder you will find the json dump of the database used in the 2013 app. For instance you can find information about the [lectures](/database/DB_DUMP.json#L54) that were held during the event.
[shuttle-buses](shuttle-buses) will give you the bus stops coordinates, the schedule of the shuttles and the maps (in pdf format) of the two CERN sites, Meyrin and Prevessin.
[sites-info](sites-info) contains other useful information like the coordinates of all the buildings and the always good to know where is the closest toilet please!!!
Probably [visit-points](visit-points) is going to be the most interesting datasource for you. It contains all the information, like coordinates, description, pictures, about the different visit points at CERN, like the [ATLAS exhibition point](https://github.com/cerndb/cern-openlab-oracle-hackzurich-2018/blob/master/visit-points/all_points_full.json#L46) 

## Other information
CERN maintains its own [Geographic Information System](https://maps.cern.ch/). It displays useful geographic data and  allowing its users to search for buildings, rooms and locations at CERN. A [mobile application](https://smb-dep.web.cern.ch/en/content/gis_mobile) also exists
